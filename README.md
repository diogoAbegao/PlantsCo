# Plant Co. Gross Profit Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)

## Summary
A performance monitoring dashboard built in Power BI to analyze **gross profit, sales and volume trends**, identify **underperforming markets**, and segment **customer profitability** for a fictional plant product company. This project demonstrates my skills in **data modeling**, **DAX**, **data visualization**, and **business insight generation**.
